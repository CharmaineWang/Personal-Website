                    <h4>The inspiration for creating my first website really began when I was first exposed to the world of web dev. After picking up some basic HTML and CSS, I continued to explore to find out more things I can do with it.<br><br>The original website had 4 main sections: Home, About, Gallery and Projects. I strictly followed a tutorial and built the website with some basic HTML, CSS and a little bit of Javascript.<br><br>I had put this website together just so I could put my work someplace online for people to see. Home was a section with all my links and resume so people can reach out to me. About was pretty straightforward, I lightly talked about myself in terms of educational background along with what I did during my last coop. Photography and illustration is something I've been tiptoeing into lately and I thought Gallery was the perfect section to display some of my artwork. Lastly, I had a section dedicated to projects that I've been working on where people can read more about it. <br><br>At the time, I really liked the looks of it. The pastel colors and personalized illustrations were cute, but the website began to look extremely template-y to me. I wanted colors that were actually meaningful. I wanted to learn to produce better code. I wanted to learn how to use SASS. I wanted the website to have a better UXUI overall. I wanted the website to be sustainable and not be easily outdated. I wanted to better communicate my ideas. I wanted a website that screamed ME. With all these thoughts that kept cycling in my mind, I decided it was time for a change...</h4>

Of course, I was on co-op during this time and was extremely busy with all the work and personal stuff, but I was quite upset with myself because I felt like I wasted a lot of time coming up with all these designs and not settling on one. This was when I realized I should change the way I was approaching this project.<br><br>Something I found myself doing a lot of the time was focusing on the home page. And by that, I mean creating an art piece that I loved and trying to build my website around it. Although I thoroughly enjoyed producing all those artworks, it got difficult when designing the rest of the website.</h4>

Similar to my first website but with different content. Each page would have my name, links and resume on it, just to make it easier for the visitors to find. On the About page, I added a short introduction about myself. Originally, I wanted a page for my work experiences and a separate one for some of my past or ongoing projects. But after some thought, I decided to narrow it down to just one page where visitors can view each case study and learn about my creative process, which is the Experiences page. And Contact just has two additional links to LinkedIn and my email. To add a hint of playfulness, I decided to incorporate a "Play" page for some of my photography and illustrations. I thought this would be a fun page to showcase my hobbies and interests.<br><br>I created a quick mockup of my website using Sketch and here's the initial design.</h4>

This time, I stuck to my design and coded my website. I think because of how minimal the design was, it made the whole process a lot more enjoyable. I was more focused on creating content rather than fixating on a specific art piece and trying to build a website around it. <br><br>I learned to look at the bigger picture first.<br><br>After finishing coding my website, that's when all the details came to place. Because I learned to integrate SASS into my coding process, it made my coding experience a lot smoother. Changing things like fonts, colors and sizing were much faster. I figured since my taste will constantly change with me, SASS was the best solution (for now at least). </h4>

It was a long process, but I picked up new skills, learned more about UXUI and completed my website!<br><br>Of course, this won't be the last time I rebrand myself, and I'm super excited to see what future Charmaine learns and builds. <br><br>But for now, I thank you for stopping by and I hope you were able to learn more about me :).</h4>
